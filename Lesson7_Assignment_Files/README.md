### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. We learned to have different subheadings automatically drop down when the user hovers over them using the hover, toggle, and animate methods. 
2. We learned to use background colors take effect only when the user hovers over a particular section of the page with the background color method in effect. 
3. We learned to use the "fade in" method so hidden objects on the page will automatically fade in slowly or quickly depending on which speed the programmer chooses.
